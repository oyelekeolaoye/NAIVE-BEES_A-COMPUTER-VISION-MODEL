# Naive-Bees-Image-Loading-Processing
Loading images in python and pre-processing steps for deep learning.

This is a part of DataCamp's structured projects and it's in 3 parts. This first part of the project focuses on image loading in python, working with the Pillow (PIL) library and some pre-processing steps necessary to perform deep learning.

My main motivation for undertaking this project is to learn how to work with images in python. It was very interesting to perform basic operations such as cropping, resizing, rotating and coverting images to different color modes. I also used kernel density plots to visualize the color composition of images. Increasing image contrast using np.maximum() function was one of the neatest trick I learnt in this project.

Have fun reading!
